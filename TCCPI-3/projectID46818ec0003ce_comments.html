<HTML><BODY><p>The Tribes and Castes of the Central Provinces is a comprehensive work of reference in four volumes. This is volume III, the last of the set to be proofread. Volumes I and IV already have been posted to PG, and Volume II is in progress.

<h3>Proofing</h3>

<p>In this work, a large number of words with macrons appear. Please type as per the guidelines. For example: [=a], [=i], [=u].

<p>The layout of this work is sometimes very complex. It uses paragraph headings in sidenotes, sometimes sets footnotes in two columns, and in a few cases uses a somewhat confusing mixed single and two column format. I've created zones in the OCR software to keep those things separate and in the right other, except for the sidenotes, which appear with the footnotes. However, if the entries appear out of order, please place them back in the correct order.

<p>If a column-break occurs in the middle of a paragraph, just join the two parts of the paragraph.

<h3>Formatting</h3>

<p>Please move the sidenotes to the proper position above the paragraph they belong to, and render them as follows: (note the colon after Sidenote. The number is part of the text of the sidenote.)

<p>[Sidenote: 12. Text of the sidenote.]

<p>Please leave (or move) the footnotes at the bottom of the page, and markup the footnote markers with square brackets thus: [1]. Mark the footnotes themselves, as per the guidelines, thus:

<p>[Footnote 7: Text of footnote.]

<p style="color:red"><b>Please leave in all references to page numbers, <i>including</i> those in the index. I need them to create HTML cross-references from.</b></BODY></HTML>
